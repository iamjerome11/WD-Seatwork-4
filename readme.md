## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is a naming format where there is no white space in separation of each word. The first word is in all lowercase while the succeeding words' first letter are in uppercase followed by lowercase letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and should relate to what it is doing or the data it holds.
7. File structure to follow below.
